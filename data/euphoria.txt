EPISODE 1.02
“Stuntin’ Like My Daddy”

1
00:00:00,795 --> 00:00:02,989
You're about to start
a brand-new chapter.
2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,058
You think 'cause I went to rehab
I stayed clean?
3
00:00:07,128 --> 00:00:09,693
Some new girl I think
you're gonna be friends with.
4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:11,267
-I'm Rue.
-Jules.
5
00:00:11,805 --> 00:00:12,756
Hi.
6
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:14,909
You're fucking crazy.
7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,391
I'm just trying to get back
at my ex-boyfriend.
8
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,537
You can stay
in a town like this,
9
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:22,192
end up like me,
10
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:24,220
living your life out
in motel rooms.
11
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:26,497
Why don't you take your top off?
12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,594
I know what you want.

00:00:30,677 --> 00:00:32,456
This bitch is gonna get
fucked up!
14
00:00:32,954 --> 00:00:34,941
You wanna fucking hurt me?
15
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:38,499
Where you headed to?
16
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:40,816
Home.
17
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,590
And then...
things got weird.
18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,591
Sometimes, when I get really high,
I kind of think I'm psychic.
19
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:16,389
When Nate Jacobs was 11 years old,
20
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:19,517
he found his dad's porn collection.
21
00:01:19,684 --> 00:01:22,061
His dad, Cal, was obsessive.
22
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:25,356
His mom always said
that's who he got it from.
23
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:27,775
Then he quickly realized
that the colored cases
24
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:30,152
and placement were no accident.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

25
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:36,408
It was an elaborate code,
that no one fucked with his shit.
26
00:01:36,575 --> 00:01:39,745
I have a very pretty dick.
Do you want to see it?
27
00:01:39,911 --> 00:01:43,290
What do you like to be called?
Mister? Master?
28
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:48,878
-Daddy?
-For you? You can call me "Daddy."
29
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:53,841
Open wider. Wider.
More like that.
30
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:57,553
- Yeah!
- Good?
31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,263
Yes, Daddy. I'll be good.
32
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,265
Every video was basically the same.
33
00:02:01,432 --> 00:02:03,892
Oh, you are all woman, aren't you?
34
00:02:04,059 --> 00:02:05,936
- Mostly.
- Mostly.
35
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:08,105
They'd drink, make small talk...
36
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:11,775
Oh, don't make me come.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I... I want to wait for that.
37
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:14,986
...and then his dad would
fuck the shit out of some...
38
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:18,614
Fucking whore.
Fucking slut.
39
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:58,610
I want to talk to you.
40
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:06,618
You're a strong man, Nathaniel.
41
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:11,372
I knew it from the moment
you were born.
42
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:16,711
You have an... iron will...
43
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,715
...drive, determination.
44
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,759
I've always admired that in you.
45
00:03:23,926 --> 00:03:26,512
Because some day, it will
lead you to greatness.
46
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,689
But no one in this world
will ever root for you.
47
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,484
They'll see what I see
and they'll despise you for it.
48
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:45,613
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Sometimes you'll know,
and sometimes you won't.
49
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,283
But the farther you go,
the sharper their blade.
50
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:53,328
Just don't ever
give them an opening.
51
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:06,049
By 12, he had adopted a rigid
diet and workout schedule.
52
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:11,846
Within a year, his body fat
dropped from 23% to 6%.
53
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,787
Ready? All right!
54
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:41,082
He joined the football team
as a freshman and quickly excelled.
55
00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:45,127
Red... Red, 32, hut!
56
00:04:45,294 --> 00:04:47,004
By the year's end,
57
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:50,674
he was not only the starting
quarterback, but the team captain.
58
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:52,718
Keep it together, Nate.
Stay focused.
59
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:55,220
All right, let's fucking go!
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
60
00:05:08,232 --> 00:05:10,985
He loved the crowds,
61
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:15,197
the cheers, the feeling of winning.
62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,328
But he hated being
in the locker room.
63
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:25,624
He hated how casual how his teammates
were about being naked...
64
00:05:27,917 --> 00:05:31,129
...how they'd talk to him
with their dicks hanging out.
65
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:34,257
He made a concerted effort
to always maintain eye contact
66
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,092
during these exchanges.
67
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:37,677
Every now and then, he'd forget,
68
00:05:37,843 --> 00:05:40,012
and accidentally catch
a glimpse of someone's penis.
69
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:59,155
His older brother Aaron
was a fuck-up.
70
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:02,533
He could tell his dad didn't like Aaron,
didn't think he had guts or brains
71
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,411
or half a fucking clue
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
and Nate agreed.
72
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:11,208
He didn't talk to his dad that much,
but they didn't need to.
73
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:13,710
They had a good relationship.
74
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:17,714
He didn't like his mother either.
She was weak, and a pushover.
75
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:20,508
Plus, she didn't
take care of herself.
76
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:22,344
He made a long mental checklist
77
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,346
of the things he liked
and disliked about women.
78
00:06:25,513 --> 00:06:28,641
He liked tennis skirts
and jean cut-offs,
79
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:31,018
but not the kind so short
you could see the pockets.
80
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:33,521
He liked ballet flats and heels.
81
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:35,481
He hated sneakers and dress shoes.
82
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:39,234
But was fine with sandals as long as
they were worn with a fresh pedicure.
83
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:41,945
He liked thigh gaps, hated cankles.
84
00:06:42,112 --> 00:06:45,741
He liked tan lines, long necks,
slender shoulders.
85
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:49,619
He liked good posture
and fruit-scented body mist.
86
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:52,747
He liked full lips, and small noses.
87
00:06:52,914 --> 00:06:54,874
He liked chokers, but the lacy ones
88
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:57,543
with flower cutouts
or delicate patterns.
89
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,590
He hated girls who sat like boys,
talked like boys, acted like boys.
90
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:07,845
But there was nothing on planet Earth
he hated more than body hair.
91
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,100
That's one of the first things
he noticed about Maddy.
92
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,018
She was basically hairless.
93
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,233
He'd walk her home
from school every day.
94
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,195
Made him feel good to know
that he was there to protect her.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
95
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,448
He knew the world was full of
men who wanted to hurt Maddy.
96
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:34,078
Men who hang out the windows of their
cars and scream obscenities at her.
97
00:07:34,244 --> 00:07:37,372
College guys who wouldn't
think twice about drugging her.
98
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,959
Lonely guys who'd spot her
at a mall.
99
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:46,131
Men who'd rape her, torture her,
sell her into sexual slavery.
100
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,883
He didn't even
like to think about it.
101
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:55,389
He did, however, like to thing about
the things he'd do to protect her.
102
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,978
If anyone ever tried to
hurt you, I'd kill them.
103
00:08:01,145 --> 00:08:04,064
You're, like, the sweetest guy ever.
104
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,528
He also liked
that Maddy was a virgin,
105
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:12,656
that no guy had ever
put his penis in her.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
106
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:16,659
-You're a virgin?
-Yeah.
107
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:19,954
-Like, fully?
-Yeah.
108
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:21,873
What about like...
109
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,211
-Have you ever been fingered?
-Only my own.
110
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:34,843
He sometimes imagined marrying
Maddy and starting a family.
111
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,304
He knew he didn't want boys, though.
112
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,098
But he also didn't like
the idea of having girls.
113
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:44,811
Plus, Maddy could be a real bitch.
114
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:49,065
Like that night at McKay's party,
something just flipped.
115
00:08:49,232 --> 00:08:52,568
And he knew he had anger issues,
but, I mean, so did every guy.
116
00:08:55,905 --> 00:08:59,867
It's not like that was anything in
his life he could trace it back to.
117
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:09:00,033 --> 00:09:04,538
It was just... who he was,
and who he'd always be.
118
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,841
What are you doing?
119
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:20,803
Nothing, I just came to...
came to say goodnight.
120
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:29,895
- Good night.
- Good night.
121
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,554
It was the first day of school,
and my heart was racing.
122
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:16,021
I made a new best friend and for the
first time since getting out of rehab,
123
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:19,358
I was feeling good about the world.
124
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:23,070
I've got an idea.
125
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:28,950
- What?
- Wanna get high?
126
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:33,121
- What is it?
- No idea.
127
00:10:33,288 --> 00:10:37,500
- Didn't you just get out of rehab?
- Yeah.
128
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:42,046
- Should I be concerned?
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
- Maybe.
129
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:47,468
- I feel like this isn't a good idea.
- I kinda disagree.
130
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,224
Rue.
131
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:06,611
Do you feel anything?
132
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:15,953
Do you feel anything?
133
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:20,582
Rue, what's wrong?
134
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:24,002
Just so happy.
135
00:11:31,217 --> 00:11:33,344
I know you're
not allowed to say it...
136
00:11:37,014 --> 00:11:39,350
...but drugs are kind of cool.
137
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:46,273
I mean, they're cool
before they wreck your skin...
138
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:49,484
- ...and your life...
139
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,195
Can you grab me a towel?
140
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:54,489
...and your family.
141
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:57,992
Gia, I need you to grab me a towel.
142
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,661
I found her down.
I gave her one dose of Narcan...
143
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:03,873
That's when they get uncool.
144
00:12:08,252 --> 00:12:11,338
It's actually a very
narrow window of cool.
145
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,016
I'll wait with you
until your mother comes home.
146
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:25,059
You want to watch some TV?
147
00:12:25,226 --> 00:12:29,105
And once you pass through
that window of cool...
148
00:12:29,272 --> 00:12:34,360
This is embarrassing.
I feel like everyone knows.
149
00:12:35,611 --> 00:12:40,032
Rue, I don't want to turn
this into a competition,
150
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:45,037
but, like, I win.
For, like, a multitude of reasons.
151
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,789
I just... I don't want to deal with
all the fucking questions.
152
00:12:47,956 --> 00:12:50,291
I still win.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
153
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,716
Wait, you're alive?
154
00:12:58,883 --> 00:13:01,594
Like, what the fuck?
155
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,931
Oh, shit, that's the girl who tried
to commit suicide at McKay's.
156
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:08,058
- Wait, what?
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.
157
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:11,144
You guys both was fuckin'.
158
00:13:11,311 --> 00:13:13,730
Why does everybody
think we fucked?
159
00:13:16,191 --> 00:13:18,526
Now Maddy knew
she had an optics issue,
160
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:21,529
along with a mountain
of evidence against her.
161
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:24,866
So, last night,
while texting with Nate...
162
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:29,036
...Maddy had an idea.
163
00:13:36,877 --> 00:13:41,214
- Alcohol is not good for me.
- So you did fuck him.
164
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:44,884
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

- Honestly, I think I blacked out.
For real?
165
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,928
Maddy!
166
00:13:47,095 --> 00:13:49,889
- Hey, you.
- Oh, look! It's our new sexpert!
167
00:13:50,056 --> 00:13:52,683
-Congratulations, bitch!
-Welcome to the club!
168
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,102
Now, when Kat told BB
she lost her virginity
169
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,022
to some dude whose name
she didn't remember, she knew
170
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:01,859
she'll tell Maddy and Cassie, and
the rest of the fucking planet Earth.
171
00:14:02,026 --> 00:14:04,194
But that was kind of the point.
172
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:07,823
She was just relived
that it was no longer a thing.
173
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,467
Hey, I'm Ethan.
174
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,221
- Please don't be a mass shooter.
- What?
175
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,349
Sorry, it's just, like, the
first thing that came to mind.

00:14:36,516 --> 00:14:41,021
Oh, my God.
Am I giving off shooter vibes?
177
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:42,647
-Yeah.
-Really?
178
00:14:42,814 --> 00:14:45,316
- Eh, you know.
- Shit.
179
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:49,153
Look, I don't know. What's
your Reddit username?
180
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,697
Um, it's IncelUprising.
181
00:14:54,033 --> 00:14:56,952
I'm joking. A joke.
182
00:15:01,331 --> 00:15:04,793
- I'm Kat.
- Uh, I'm Ethan.
183
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,379
Yeah, you said that.
184
00:15:07,545 --> 00:15:12,258
Okay, listen up, everybody.
Welcome to Biology 301.
185
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:15,720
So, let's start with
a little improvisation.
186
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:17,555
I'd like each of you to get up
187
00:15:17,722 --> 00:15:21,058
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
and tell us a five-minute story
about your summer.
188
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:25,604
Looks like we have
our first volunteer: Rue.
189
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:27,397
Please don't do this to me.
190
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:31,026
Come on, everyone. Let's give
her a little encouragement.
191
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:56,133
A memory?
192
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,594
Anything that had
an impact on you this summer.
193
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:06,226
I don't... I don't...
I can't think of...
194
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:13,691
Just... relax your body.
Release the tension.
195
00:16:15,109 --> 00:16:18,112
And just breathe.
196
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,282
We recommend taking her directly
to the rehabilitation center.
197
00:16:28,371 --> 00:16:32,709
- So this... this summer?
- Yes.
198
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,856
Let's go.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
199
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:06,157
I'm having trouble, like, remembering
something, you know.
200
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:10,119
Just tell us a specific memory.
201
00:17:10,286 --> 00:17:12,746
Uh, okay. Uh...
202
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:16,458
I was, um, with my mom,
and my, uh, my little sister,
203
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:20,170
and we were, uh,
listening to this... this song.
204
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:38,437
I know you know this song.
205
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:39,078
Are you doing drugs in my house?
Are you doing drugs in my house?
206
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,121
What are you doing?
207
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,711
I'm not joking!
208
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,171
I need to...
I need to go!
209
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,966
-Dad's so fucking proud, Mom.
-Oh, really?
210
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,094
Dad's so fucking proud.

00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,720
Get off of me!
212
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,597
- I don't give...
- Get off of me!
213
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:04,143
Back the fuck up. Back the fuck up and
let me out of this fucking house.
214
00:20:07,869 --> 00:20:11,289
I'm sorry, but I...
I can't think of anything, so...
215
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,960
Just...
216
00:20:17,879 --> 00:20:21,632
I'm, uh... I'm done. I can't.
217
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:24,343
- Do I have to do this?
- She's a mess, dude.
218
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:29,056
- Honestly, I bet it's brain damage.
- You're being fucking rude.
219
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,001
Fuck.
220
00:21:03,964 --> 00:21:06,925
Rue, it's me.
221
00:21:08,843 --> 00:21:13,514
- Are you okay?
-You are so fucking stupid, Lexi.
222
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:15,600
-Why?
-'Cause I already flushed everything
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

223
00:21:15,766 --> 00:21:17,184
down the fucking toilet.
224
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:18,728
Well, I just came to check on you.
225
00:21:18,894 --> 00:21:22,690
I don't want you to fucking check on me,
whether I'm fine or I'm not fine.
226
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:26,026
What difference are you going to make?
Are you going to give me a life advice?
227
00:21:26,193 --> 00:21:30,113
-You gonna fucking help me?
-Well, you're one of my best friends.
228
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,783
Give me a fucking break. 'Cause we
went to fucking pre-school together?
229
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,786
That does not make us
best fucking friends.
230
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:40,373
You say all this,
but what happens in three days
231
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,126
when you knock on my door asking
me to piss in some Tylenol bottle?
232
00:21:44,293 --> 00:21:46,003
What, you're gonna say the opposite?
233
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:49,006
How we've known each other since
pre-school and we're best friends?

It's like you have
a split personality disorder.
235
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:55,179
Sorry if I miss the old you.
236
00:22:01,893 --> 00:22:07,523
I slept like shit, too.
Yeah, I miss you.
237
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:23,929
-My name is Ali, and I'm an addict.
-Hi, Ali.
238
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:26,222
Actually, an addict
is a nice word for it.
239
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:29,601
I was a stone-cold crackhead.
240
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:33,980
I was also a firefighter, so I thought,
the two might cancel each other out.
241
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:38,692
As long as I saved lives, I was well
within my right to destroy my own.
242
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:43,155
The problem was, I was...
243
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:47,117
I was also a father,
to two young girls.
244
00:23:48,618 --> 00:23:51,913
My girls live in Texas.
245
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,752
I speak to them whenever I can.
Drugs can take away a lot.

The first time
I tried Oxycontin, I was 13.
247
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:07,595
What do these feel like?
248
00:24:10,514 --> 00:24:13,016
They're the absolute worst.
249
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:17,104
I used to take care
of my dad after school
250
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,690
had to take a second
job to cover the medical bills.
251
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:27,447
A state-issued nurse would come
by every day for two hours,
252
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:31,701
and she'd, legit, just play
Candy Crush on her phone.
253
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:38,040
But, anyway, the point is,
he had, like, a bunch of pills.
254
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:24,500
He was too out of it
to know I was high.
255
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:27,878
And I always have
the best time with you.
256
00:25:28,045 --> 00:25:30,297
Me, too.

Do you mind?!
258
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:43,977
Hey. Uh, I'm gonna need you
to do me a big favor.
259
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:46,271
You see, there are
a bunch of these meetings
260
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:51,400
that I was supposed to attend
that I didn't actually attend, so...
261
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:55,154
I'm gonna need you
to backdate this slip.
262
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:02,161
Yeah. Ethically, that's a line
I will not cross.
263
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:12,420
What if I, uh... suck your dick?
264
00:26:18,593 --> 00:26:21,554
Like, in my car?
265
00:26:21,721 --> 00:26:25,015
I'm 17, you fucking creep.
Sign the slip.
266
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,860
-Pleasure doing business with you.
-Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
267
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:48,746
Rue.
268
00:26:50,623 --> 00:26:54,627
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

Fuck, yeah.
271
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,460
Fucking slut.
272
00:27:42,797 --> 00:27:46,842
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck...
273
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:03,817
She never admitted it,
and no one could ever prove it,
274
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:05,902
but we all knew it was her.
275
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:32,469
Or, I don't know, I guess for Kat,
it probably felt like we all knew.
276
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:36,848
That's the weird thing
about the Internet.
277
00:28:37,014 --> 00:28:39,600
Ten people can feel like
the whole world.
278
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:48,650
Meet me in the cafeteria in
five minutes. We need to talk.
279
00:28:48,817 --> 00:28:50,819
Why?
280
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,866
Listen, Kat. I didn't do anything.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

I told Roy not to post it.
281
00:28:56,032 --> 00:29:00,078
It doesn't matter, okay? He's still
sending it to people and saying it's me.
282
00:29:00,245 --> 00:29:02,247
Look, I don't want
my life to be ruined,
283
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:04,874
and I'm sure you don't want to
end up on a sex offender list.
284
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:09,628
-Kat, you know I'm not a sex offender.
-It's child pornography, you dumb fuck.
285
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:13,173
But we're all under 18. Children
can't make child pornography.
286
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,136
-Troy, google it.
-I'm not googling child pornography.
287
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:21,223
You know what? Fuck it. Fuck
it, I'm going to the police.
288
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:25,518
All right! Okay. Okay, okay, I get it.
What do you need?
289
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:28,188
First, for you to delete the video off
your phone...
290
00:29:28,354 --> 00:29:31,065
-...and whoever's phone you sent it to.
-That is done.
291
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:35,152
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

And for you to tell Wes to tell
everybody that it's not me. Okay?
292
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:39,198
Okay. Done.
Anything else?
293
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:42,034
Actually, yeah.
294
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:45,495
So even though Roy and Troy
tried to put an end to it,
295
00:29:45,662 --> 00:29:48,999
Kat? Nah.
It was some other bitch.
296
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:52,419
Oh, dude. What the fuck?
I thought you said it was Kat.
297
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:54,963
I did, but, I mixed that bitch up.
298
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,924
By the end of the week...
299
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:13,564
Katherine Hernandez, please report
to the principal's office.
300
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,441
Katherine Hernandez
to the principal's office.
301
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,944
I heard a very disturbing rumor.
302
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,322
- About what?
- There is a recording of you
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
303
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:26,200
engaged in... sexual activity.
304
00:30:26,367 --> 00:30:31,789
Or something to that effect, that is
being shared amongst the students.
305
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,959
Is this about that video of that
girl getting banged from behind?
306
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:38,670
Because no, it's not me, but...
just out of sheer curiosity,
307
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,381
what could have possibly
led you to believe that is was?
308
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:45,218
I just want to be clear that I haven't
personally seen the video...
309
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,013
It is because the girl in the
video is fat, Principal Hayes?
310
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:50,890
I'm not jumping
to conclusions, Katherine...
311
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,726
I'd just appreciate it if everyone would
stop talking to me like it was,
312
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,730
because, frankly, it's... offensive.
313
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,982
You know, it's one thing for my
classmates to body shame me,
314
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:05,571
but for you, Principal Hayes
that's just... a whole nother thing.
315
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:09,283
It's degrading.
It's... discriminatory.
316
00:31:09,449 --> 00:31:12,119
And it just goes to show
how insidious, and...
317
00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:15,997
systemic body terrorism
truly is in this country.
318
00:31:16,164 --> 00:31:18,541
From my own principal.
319
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:23,296
Well, I'm... I'm...
I... I can't apologize enough.
320
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:25,756
And I give you my word,
321
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:30,094
I will do everything in my power
to put an end to this rumor.
322
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,097
Thank you, Principal Hayes.
323
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:35,265
And so on the same way
that mass shootings,
324
00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:37,643
sex scandals,
and stolen elections do,
325
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:40,979
the whole thing blew over pretty quickly

and we all moved on to the next thing.
326
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:42,981
- You guys pumped?
- Yeah!
327
00:31:43,148 --> 00:31:46,151
- Are we gonna win?
- Yeah!
328
00:31:46,317 --> 00:31:51,114
Then let's hear it for the
East Highland Blackhawks!
329
00:32:01,665 --> 00:32:03,834
Yeah, Nate!
330
00:32:36,615 --> 00:32:38,700
Hey, let's go!
331
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,040
I, 100 percent,
do not feel safe right now.
332
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:49,293
No. So stay
the fuck out of my grill.
333
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,421
-Yo, Maddy.
-What?
334
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:56,925
- Let me take you out tonight.
- Why?
335
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,681
-I hate you.
-I know.
336
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,685
Seriously?
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
337
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:08,812
Seriously?
338
00:33:08,978 --> 00:33:11,189
Seriously.
339
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:15,109
-I'm over it.
-Rue!
340
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,778
Breathing is clearly not
a priority to you.
341
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:20,197
- Ding, ding, ding!
- I see. Oh...
342
00:33:24,743 --> 00:33:26,828
Fuck.
343
00:33:26,995 --> 00:33:29,581
Uh, you wanna come over
for dinner tonight?
344
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:34,461
I wish. But my dad wants to have like
a capital F, capital D Family Dinner.
345
00:33:34,627 --> 00:33:37,088
Which is weird, because it's
literally just me and him
346
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:39,507
eating dinner together,
like, every single night.
347
00:33:41,676 --> 00:33:43,636
Well, um, what about later?
348
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:47,848
I'm probably gonna do some homework.

Binge-watch some Madoka Magica.
349
00:33:48,015 --> 00:33:51,310
Okay, well, um,
maybe you could, like,
350
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:55,564
come over Sunday night, 'cause my
mom's, like, asking me and stuff.
351
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:01,069
Are you talking
to your momma about me?
352
00:34:01,236 --> 00:34:04,447
No. Shut up.
353
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:11,662
-Bye, Rue.
-Bye.
354
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,585
I'm such a loser.
355
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:43,109
Maddy, I just want to say
that I'm sorry.
356
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:00,833
Cash or credit?
357
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:16,348
- Christopher McKay.
- Yep.
358
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:19,518
Drove down from college
for the weekend.
359
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,228
Yep.

361
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:29,068
Uh, you know.
Just... mm.
362
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:34,740
Cassie's smitten like
a kitten with you.
363
00:35:34,907 --> 00:35:37,993
Yeah?
Yeah, she's a pretty cool girl.
364
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,580
Well, I tell ya, it's not
easy to hold her attention.
365
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:44,917
Uh-uh. Like mother,
like daughter.
366
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:49,504
But she's a good girl.
She's got a good heart.
367
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:51,715
Yeah. Handle with care.
368
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:56,886
-I will.
-Mom, stop talking to him.
369
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:59,263
Excuse me.
I've been dismissed.
370
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:03,434
You have fun.
Ooh, you look so pretty.

Yeah, come on.
373
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:21,368
Maddy. Why don't you let me
take you out tonight?
374
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:24,412
I don't know.
Text me.
375
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:59,153
All right.
No cell phones during dinner.
376
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:07,035
I don't think I have an attention
span for real life anymore.
377
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:09,788
Shut up, you smart ass.
378
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,941
Hey, open the door!
379
00:37:44,279 --> 00:37:46,739
- What do you want?
- Open the fucking door.
380
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,788
- Yo, who is it, man?
- Rue.
381
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:56,791
No, bro, tell her to
come back later. Yo.
382
00:37:56,957 --> 00:37:59,627

384
00:38:02,212 --> 00:38:05,507
-Nah, nah.
-I need some some OCs and some socks.
385
00:38:05,674 --> 00:38:08,051
I can't help you
right now. You gotta go.
386
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:10,929
Yo, for real, Rue. I ain't fuckin'
playing with you. Come on.
387
00:38:11,096 --> 00:38:13,264
-You can't be in here.
-Look, Fez,
388
00:38:13,431 --> 00:38:16,184
I'm fucking drenched.
Okay?
389
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:21,439
And, uh... I'm out of drugs. So...
Don't be a dick.
390
00:38:21,606 --> 00:38:23,858
Oh, my God.
That's not my fucking problem.
391
00:38:24,024 --> 00:38:25,734
You gotta get up
out of my house right now
392
00:38:25,901 --> 00:38:27,528
before these motherfuckers
come through.
393
00:38:27,695 --> 00:38:30,614
All I need is a couple OCs,
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
and some Xannies.
394
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,658
That's all
I need, and I can be gone.
395
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:35,827
Yo, I'm trying to tell you, I
don't got shit right now. Like...
396
00:38:35,994 --> 00:38:38,580
Come back in a few hours,
I got you, whatever you need.
397
00:38:38,747 --> 00:38:41,457
But right now, you gotta get
the fuck up outta my house.
398
00:38:41,624 --> 00:38:43,167
I know you have something, Fez.
399
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:46,587
I'm just telling you, I don't
got shit for you, Rue, come on.
400
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:48,839
I need you out the house right now.
401
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,092
My guy's about to come through here.
I don't want you here
402
00:38:51,258 --> 00:38:52,968
when he gets here, you understand?
403
00:38:53,135 --> 00:38:56,430
- Give me drugs.
- This is dead serious.
404
00:38:56,597 --> 00:38:58,432
Yo, Rue.
405
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:15,406
I could fucking kill you right now.
406
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:21,078
Yo, Ash, they're here.
407
00:39:32,547 --> 00:39:34,257
Look, I'm serious, Rue.
408
00:39:34,424 --> 00:39:38,469
Just stay right there, keep
your mouth shut, and be cool.
409
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:41,097
These dudes ain't fucking around.
410
00:39:41,264 --> 00:39:44,225
Now, I'm not gonna lie. That's when
I started to get a little scared.
411
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:47,853
I mean, I'm all good with drugs
until guns start coming out.
412
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,916
Coming out of East Highland,
I've held the state record
413
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,127
for most receiving yards
the last two years in row.
414
00:40:57,293 --> 00:40:59,045
I broke East Highland records
for the most receptions,
415
00:40:59,212 --> 00:41:01,089
the most yards
during the game: 112,
416
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:03,299
most yards per catch,
most yards after the catch.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
417
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:05,885
And I can fucking block.
418
00:41:06,052 --> 00:41:08,095
And this coach is acting like
he don't want to start me.
419
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:11,682
Like I haven't earned my due on the
field or something. That's bullshit.
420
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:13,934
Don't they do that to,
like, all the freshmen?
421
00:41:14,101 --> 00:41:19,106
I'm not all freshman. Look at my stats.
Shit pisses me off. I don't get it.
422
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:26,488
-You want to kill him?
-What?
423
00:41:26,654 --> 00:41:28,990
Let's fucking kill him.
424
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,912
Cass, I'm serious.
425
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:37,039
It's not funny. This motherfucker
really pissed me off.
426
00:41:37,206 --> 00:41:41,085
Come on, McKay.
It just takes time.
427
00:41:48,091 --> 00:41:52,804
I thought about you all week.
I'm dying to fuck you.
428
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,310
Why you gotta make
everything so sexual?
429
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:02,980
What?
430
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:08,527
I'm trying to have a real-ass
conversation with you.
431
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,531
I'm... I'm sorry.
432
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,247
It's cool, Cassie.
It's all right.
433
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,517
-So this your little bitch?
-Nah, bruh, that's my little sister.
434
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:47,564
Well, hello, there, little sis.
435
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:51,943
Now, when Fez said
his dudes were coming over,
436
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:55,571
I didn't think his dude
would be this dude.
437
00:42:55,738 --> 00:42:59,158
My name is Mouse.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
438
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:03,120
But you know, that's what happens
when you hang out with drug dealers.
439
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:05,247
Yo, Custer, toss me that bag.

I got a 100 OP-OC 80s,
500 Xanny bars, 500 20s of Addy.
442
00:43:13,421 --> 00:43:15,882
I'm low on Vikes, so if
you wanna cop some Vikes,
443
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:18,301
you better cop 'em today,
'cause I got, like, 50 left.
444
00:43:18,468 --> 00:43:22,472
I got a quap of that Cali
medicinal, and an ounce of Molly.
445
00:43:22,638 --> 00:43:27,143
-Custer, what's the math on that?
-Uh, 25, 15, and 1,100,
446
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:32,481
35, 77, and 25...
7,750.
447
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:40,739
Here.
448
00:43:42,991 --> 00:43:46,911
-Sure you don't want no Fentanyl?
-Nah, man, I'm cool off that shit.
449
00:43:47,078 --> 00:43:50,373
There's too many ODs,
and I don't want the heat.
450
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,793
How about you, little sis?

- No, she's good, bruh.
452
00:43:58,672 --> 00:44:01,467
Gonna let big brother talk for you?
453
00:44:01,633 --> 00:44:05,470
-I don't know.
-Don't look at him. Look at me.
454
00:44:05,637 --> 00:44:07,639
You ever try it?
455
00:44:08,848 --> 00:44:12,519
Yo, for real, bruh. I don't want
her fucking with that shit.
456
00:44:12,685 --> 00:44:14,395
You know that feeling
when you come so hard
457
00:44:14,562 --> 00:44:16,981
that you can't feel or hear shit?
458
00:44:19,609 --> 00:44:23,237
- You like that feeling?
- Yeah.
459
00:44:23,404 --> 00:44:26,865
Well, shit.
You gonna love this.
460
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:35,415
I'm... I'm good, actually.
461
00:44:35,582 --> 00:44:39,919
- What, you don't trust me?
- Yo, for real, man. She's good.

Tell him,
"Shut the fuck up."

It's not gonna bite you.

00:45:04,442 --> 00:45:06,611
Oh, just try it.
468
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:11,491
Dear God, I know I've been a cunt
for, like, a lot of my life,
469

and my family
and I am so, so, so sorry, but...

Get the fuck out of my apartment.

If you're looking for the
kitchen knives, they're here.
476
00:45:54,031 --> 00:45:56,616
Same with the baseball bat
from your room.

Who the fuck are you, man?
478
00:46:03,289 --> 00:46:06,376
I'm the boyfriend of the girl
that you raped on Saturday night.
479
00:46:08,878 --> 00:46:11,547
No, no. Dude, what the fuck?
I wouldn't rape anyone.
480

I swear to God,

hand as they walked down the hall.

it had garnered 184,265 notes,

and then three weeks later,
Kat had amassed over 53,000 followers.
113
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:15,083
She had become
extremely popular...
114

online.
115
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:18,999

life was actually super depressing.

Ew!
Take those things off.
119
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:38,416
She'd regularly fantasize
about telling her followers
120
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,625
how much she hated
her school, her town,
121
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,958
and how everyone in it was full
of shit and a fucking asshole.
122
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,625
She'd tell them
to surround the school,

00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:47,958
show up right after the
morning bell prepared for war.
124
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:58,708

00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,291

is they'd actually do it.

- I'm sorry. My phone died.
- Bullshit. You're doing drugs.
160

- I'm not doing drugs.
- Then where have you been?

You're doing drugs.

Yeah, Gia, I'm fine.
You can go back to sleep.

She's okay, baby.
Okay, go to bed. Good night.

I will not allow you
to walk up into this house

at 5:30 in the morning
and lie to my face.
172
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,583

Mom, I don't want to have to tell you

I didn't mean to do this.
181
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:23,958
I've been through, like...
182
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:28,083
enough traumatic shit
in my life that I don't...
183
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,416
- I can't like...
- I get it.

194
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,625
I told you I wasn't lying.
195
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:40,291
So, I decided to stay clean.
196
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,541
And I have been, for a while.
197
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,750

Ah! Oh, God. So good!
200

Hmm, I don't know.
I just didn't want to depress anyone.
201
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,249
Plus, I really have been trying,
202
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,833
and that counts for something.
203
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,667
Two months ago,
I woke up from a comma.
204
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:11,500
I didn't know what happened,
205
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:16,124
but from the looks of my mother
and little sister's faces,
206
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,041
I knew that...
207
00:13:18,124 --> 00:13:20,917
whatever it was,
whatever I did...
208
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,541
it wasn't good.
209
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,166
It scared them.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

211
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:42,124
And, uh, at that moment,
I decided to at least try and change.
212
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,291
'Cause I owe it to them.
213
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:48,041
I owe it to everyone I love,
and everyone who loves me.
214
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,249
The hardest part, uh,
has been...
215
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,583
feeling like I owe it to myself.
216
00:14:02,124 --> 00:14:06,249
And, uh, maybe
that'll get easier.
217
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,833
I hope it will.
218
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,124

They're both little fuckboy names.

who finds her big sister
overdosed.
520
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,792
What that moment
must do to somebody...
521
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:26,625
how it affects the rest of their
lives, you know,
522

how it affects
their ability to trust.
523
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:33,875
Leaves it hard for them to get close
to people, you know, relationships.
524
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,416
Makes it hard for them
to fall in love.
525
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:39,625
Living with the fear
that at any moment,
526
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:42,833
the rug can be ripped out from under
them, and they lose everything.
527

to make peace with the fact

It doesn't work.
853
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,917
Honestly, Jules,
I don't really care about the situation,
854
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,041
because it just doesn't
seem safe.
855
00:48:57,124 --> 00:48:59,833
I've been in situations that
are way less safe. Like...
856
00:48:59,917 --> 00:49:01,792

really the point, right?

Open the door!
931
00:54:17,833 --> 00:54:19,500
Open the door.
932
00:54:22,583 --> 00:54:25,083
You did this to me!

00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:28,792
You fucking...
You did this to me, Fez.
934
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,917
You fucking ruined my life!
935
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:37,416
The least you could do is open
the goddamned door and fix it!
936
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,917
I'm fucking serious.
I'm so fucking serious.
937
00:54:40,999 --> 00:54:44,999
If you don't open this door
right now, I swear to God,
938
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:48,667
I will hate you,
till the day I fucking die.
939
00:54:51,541 --> 00:54:53,208
I'm sorry.
940
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:58,083
You fucking did this to me!
941
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:01,625
Open the fucking door.
942
00:55:01,708 --> 00:55:03,667
Open the door, Fez!
943
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,291
Come on, man!

00:55:05,375 --> 00:55:07,541

her mother took her on a trip.
967
00:57:58,208 --> 00:57:59,792
Are you making any friends?
968
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:01,875
- Not really.
- Well, that'll change.
969
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,291
Although she had never been
in a relationship,
970
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:08,083
Jules imagined spending a life
with her new best friend.

But that was before Tyler.

00:58:10,625 --> 00:58:13,041
Does the words you feel
remind you of anything?
973
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:14,875
The feelings?
974
00:58:17,041 --> 00:58:18,416
The... withdrawal?
975
00:58:20,416 --> 00:58:21,750
Your obsession?

00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:46,782
2
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:55,823
I don't understand why we have to drive
seven hours to see a psychiatrist.
3
00:00:57,742 --> 00:01:01,243
Because... we want the
best care possible for you.
4
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:03,537
When Jules was
eleven years old,
5
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,583
her mother took her on a road trip.
6
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,525
- Wasn't Dali, like, a sexual predator?
- Was he?
7
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,276
I hadn't heard that before.
8
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:36,362
Would you like me to take it down?
9
00:01:36,364 --> 00:01:38,822
No. It's a cool painting.
10
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:40,616
It is a cool painting.
11
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:42,368
He was actually
really sweet, though.
12
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,662
They talked for over an hour,
13
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:01:44,664 --> 00:01:48,042
and only later did Jules realize
that she hadn't lied once.
14
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:58,761
After the session, they wanted
to give her a tour of the Unit.
15
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:06,684
- Well, what's the Unit?
- Think of it like a second home,
16
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:09,603
where children can learn how
to feel better about themselves.
17
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:11,313
Okay.
18
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:12,900
Let me give you a tour.
19
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,153
So, this is our common area,
20
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:20,364
where we have group sessions,
21
00:02:20,366 --> 00:02:22,783
watch movies, play games,
22
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:24,868
have art class.
23
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,747
Um, on Tuesdays we have
canine therapy.
24
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,544
Uh, Thursdays we have music therapy.
25
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,053

- Dr. Kay!
- Allan!
26
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:44,181
Suck my dick, you fucking cunt!
27
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:47,935
Allan!
28
00:02:52,064 --> 00:02:54,565
Usually there's two to a room,
29
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:57,069
depending on how many patients
are with us.
30
00:03:02,908 --> 00:03:04,908
So the kids live here?
31
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,828
For short periods of time.
32
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,207
And this is the quiet room.
33
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,210
I'm gonna fucking
rape you, Dr. Kay!
34
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,881
You just bought yourself another
30 minutes in the quiet room, Jesse.
35
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:20,674
It was around
then when Jules thought
36
00:03:20,676 --> 00:03:23,052
she had just about
had enough of the tour.
37
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:24,430
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I think I wanna go home.
38
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:31,562
And that's when Jules realized,
this wasn't a tour at all.
39
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:34,730
It was an elaborate plan
to admit her
40
00:03:34,732 --> 00:03:37,775
to a fucking psychiatric hospital.
41
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,569
Mom! Mom!
42
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,113
No, no, no, no, no!
43
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:48,118
No! No! No!
44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,037
During the ensuing
struggle, Jules accidentally
45
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,914
scratched an RA across the face,
46
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,460
which she felt really guilty about.
47
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,840
But quickly, that guilt
turned into anger...
48
00:04:01,801 --> 00:04:04,553
and that anger, into defeat.
49
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,973
Hi. I'm Jules.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
50
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:11,850
- How are you feeling?
- Better.
51
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,144
Good. Good.
52
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:17,690
Why don't you tell the group a little
about yourself and why you're here.
53
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,316
I don't know.
54
00:04:19,318 --> 00:04:23,696
Maybe because I was, like,
sad for a really long time.
55
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,364
What do you mean by a long time?
56
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:28,575
Maybe since I was
seven or eight or something.
57
00:04:28,577 --> 00:04:31,745
And I've been to see,
like, a bunch of doctors.
58
00:04:31,747 --> 00:04:33,580
I've been on, like,
a bunch of medications,
59
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:35,958
but nothing's really helped, so...
60
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,377
Maybe these mitts will do the trick.
61
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,716
And, Jules, do you self-injure?
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
62
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:46,387
The truth was,
Jules hated herself.
63
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:50,349
She hated
how her brain worked...
64
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:54,560
the way it would
get stuck on a thought,
65
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,230
like choking.
66
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,944
All right. Keep present.
67
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:06,488
And it would just play
on an infinite loop,
68
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,616
until she couldn't think
69
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,618
or breathe or stand to be alive.
70
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,579
This is hard, Jules.
You're going to get through it, okay?
71
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,414
She didn't just
hate her brain, though.
72
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:18,667
She hated her body, not every part,
73
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:21,295
just her shoulders, and her arms,
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
74
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:23,172
and her hands.
75
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:26,300
Also her chest,
her stomach, her thighs.
76
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:27,968
Her knees were the worst.
77
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,515
Plus her ankles, and her big,
fucking, stupid feet.
78
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:37,144
She hated her life,
not because it was bad,
79
00:05:37,146 --> 00:05:40,147
but because when you hate
your brain and your body,
80
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:42,608
it's hard to enjoy the rest.
81
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,528
So, Jules developed
a few coping mechanisms.
82
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,492
None of them healthy, and a few
scary enough to land her in...
83
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:57,873
So, how are you liking the Unit?
84
00:05:57,875 --> 00:05:59,293
It's okay.
85
00:06:00,252 --> 00:06:03,047
- Are you making any friends?
- Not really.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
86
00:06:04,215 --> 00:06:06,423
Well, that'll change.
87
00:06:06,425 --> 00:06:08,469
Wait. Can you leave
me the rest?
88
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,848
Sure.
89
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:43,963
- This guy did some damage.
- Allan?
90
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:47,631
I did something really stupid.
91
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,050
Is everything okay?
92
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:51,887
I'm so sorry.
93
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,682
Please don't be mad at me.
94
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,486
Eventually Jules got
better and came home.
95
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,911
But her mom got
worse and went away.
96
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,916
And her dad quit his
job to be closer to home,
97
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,170
which she liked,
'cause she loved her dad.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
98
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:29,340
By 13, she started to transition.
99
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:33,719
And by 16, Jules had gotten
a little slutty.
100
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:36,013
And every guy was the same:
101
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:38,807
cis, white, married,
102
00:07:38,809 --> 00:07:41,852
engaged, in long-term relationships,
103
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:43,604
and always, always...
104
00:07:43,606 --> 00:07:46,943
I mean,
I'm a hundred percent straight.
105
00:07:48,736 --> 00:07:50,863
Um, cool.
106
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,951
So do you like top?
107
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:59,119
- No.
- Cool.
108
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,540
'Cause that's, like, not my thing.
109
00:08:13,886 --> 00:08:17,014
Some were sweet.
Some were weird.
110
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:19,642
And a few were aggressive.
111
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,353
Spit.
112
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,608
And whenever anything
got too uncomfortable...
113
00:08:29,485 --> 00:08:32,361
...Jules would just imagine
that she wasn't really herself,
114
00:08:32,363 --> 00:08:35,239
and this wasn't really her life.
115
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:39,326
She was just a character
in a book or a movie or a show.
116
00:08:39,328 --> 00:08:43,539
That none of it was real, and
if it was, how did it matter?
117
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:46,168
It's not like her body ever really
belonged to her in the first place.
118
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:53,551
But fuck it.
She'd save it for the memoirs.
119
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:59,555
'Cause that was the night
she met her new best friend.
120
00:08:59,557 --> 00:09:02,391
And although she had never
really been in a relationship
121
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,893
or even in, like, love,
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
122
00:09:04,895 --> 00:09:08,439
she imagined spending
the rest of her life with her.
123
00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,567
How they'd live together in
some shitty New York apartment,
124
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:15,446
and maybe date other people, but
always sleep in the same bed.
125
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:19,116
She even said it to her once,
which was probably a mistake,
126
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:21,662
for, like, a lot of reasons.
127
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:26,206
Plus, that was before
she fell for Tyler,
128
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,920
like, hard, like, really hard.
129
00:09:35,092 --> 00:09:37,468
What are you smiling about?
130
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,181
I don't know.
Just... life.
131
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:05,623
There's nothing I'm
really passionate about.
132
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:11,251
You know, like, I'm not dying
to say or do anything, really.
133

00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:13,462
And every time
I admit that to people,
134
00:10:13,464 --> 00:10:16,090
they're like, "Oh, my gosh,
that's so sad." But...
135
00:10:16,092 --> 00:10:18,968
I think that's the case
for most people.
136
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,013
You know? Like, when I look
at my mom or...
137
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,974
like, the kids at my school...
138
00:10:24,976 --> 00:10:28,813
like, their profiles or their
posts and their Tumblr rants...
139
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,109
you realize they're all just
fucked up, too... and lost.
140
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:38,612
They just have
a reason to mask it...
141
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:41,323
whether it be, like,
their, their families
142
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:45,121
or their boyfriends
or their hashtag activism.
143
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,832
And they're just reaching
for something
144
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:52,084
- to make it all seem meaningful.
- Rue...
145
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:54,003
But sometimes
I just sit and think...
146
00:10:54,005 --> 00:10:55,879
- Rue. Rue.
- ...like, what's the point?
147
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:58,299
Rue, I don't give a shit.
148
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,720
- Why'd you call me?
- Honestly...
149
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,141
I didn't really have
anybody else to call.
150
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:11,022
Well, what happened
to make you call?
151
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,692
Um...
152
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:21,782
you know...
153
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,536
just like...
154
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:30,875
Open the fucking door!
Fuck!
155
00:11:33,044 --> 00:11:35,002
...just the usual bullshit.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

156
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:38,758
Rue, you know that drug addicts
don't reach out for help
157
00:11:39,634 --> 00:11:41,552
unless there's no options.
158
00:11:42,553 --> 00:11:44,138
So what happened?
159
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,561
Um...
160
00:11:51,646 --> 00:11:53,604
I was with my best friend.
161
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:55,940
Okay, well, she's...
I mean, she's a new friend,
162
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,985
but we hang out every day.
163
00:11:58,611 --> 00:12:00,071
And, um...
164
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:05,074
It's stupid.
It's stupid.
165
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,953
- What?
- I just...
166
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:13,417
I misread...
the whole situation.
167
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:18,045
And now it's gonna be
really, really, really...
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
168
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,381
really fucking awkward.
169
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:23,467
And I guess that
170
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:26,595
hanging out with her was...
171
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:30,559
was the best thing that's
happened to me in a while, so...
172
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,065
Does the way in which you feel
about her remind you of anything?
173
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:42,611
- What do you mean?
- You know, like... the obsession,
174
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:45,741
the feelings, the withdrawal.
175
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,328
What, like drugs?
176
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:52,579
Bingo.
177
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:55,209
Okay, but this is a good thing.
178
00:12:56,127 --> 00:13:00,339
Didn't drugs feel real good
the first time you tried 'em?
179
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:12,893
Shit.
180
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:29,033

Yeah. It's gon' be
a good night, tonight, man.

Let's get this money.
182
00:13:41,547 --> 00:13:43,255
What's good, bro?
183
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,049
Fuck.
184
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,675
- You wanna go on the Gravitron?
- Uh, no.
185
00:13:46,677 --> 00:13:48,218
- The Ferris wheel?
- Nope.
186
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,179
- Why?
- Because I don't wanna die.
187
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:53,891
Where are you? I'm standing
by the fucking Ferris wheel.
188
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:56,310
I don't see you.
189
00:13:56,312 --> 00:14:02,441
Why do you always do this to me?
190
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:05,402
- Whoa! Whoa! Aah!
- We're gonna die, die!
191
00:14:05,404 --> 00:14:08,697
Oh, my God.

the fucking thing.

00:14:14,205 --> 00:14:16,499
- You're rocking...
- Oh, my God.
195
00:14:18,751 --> 00:14:21,585
Yo, are you at this Ferris
wheel or that Ferris wheel?
196
00:14:21,587 --> 00:14:23,754
Well, how the fuck am I supposed
to know which one you're at?
197
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,464
You don't fucking tell me...
198
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,174
Yeah, I know, I know.
I'm on my way. I...
199
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:29,679
How am I supposed to know that
there's two Ferris wheels?
200
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,182
- Yo, why are dressed like a hooker?
- What?
201
00:14:35,184 --> 00:14:37,685
Jesus Christ, Maddy.
I'm here with my parents.
202
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:40,062
- So what? It's the carnival.
- No. It's the chili cook-off.
203
00:14:40,064 --> 00:14:41,605
It's very important. I can't have you
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

204
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,148
hanging out at the booth
dressed like that.
205
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,775
Yeah, well maybe it'll sell better.
206
00:14:44,777 --> 00:14:47,194
Yo, this isn't a fucking joke, okay?
207
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,821
Why are you being like this?
208
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:51,615
Listen, my parents
already don't like you.
209
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:52,994
What?
210
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:56,245
Go home, get changed,
211
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:59,125
and come back looking like a person.
Fuck.
212
00:15:06,424 --> 00:15:08,382
- Well, did you break up again?
- No.
213
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,342
- Looks like you broke up again.
- No, we didn't.
214
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:13,014
If you ask me, she's a distraction.
215

Hands and feet inside the ride

221

- Hey.
222

I'm really fucking scared.

Oh, no!

- Hi.
- Hey.

- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.
226
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:42,559
Um, I think she's in love with her.
227
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,436
Really?

Yeah, like... Rue is in
love with Jules, I think.

- Are you mad at me?
- No. No, no.

Are you mad at me?
231
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,032
- No.
- Okay.
232

Don't you think?
233
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:01,370
I hadn't really thought about it.
234
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:04,331
Oh. I don't know.
235
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,126
Can we just pretend like
what I did wasn't super-weird?
236
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:10,337
- It wasn't weird. It...
- It was weird, but...
237
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,383
we don't have to talk about it.
238
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,926
Talk about what?
239
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:18,637

- Right.

- Uh-oh. Mr. Jacobs.
- Oh!
243

- Stingray McKay.
- I see you...
244

- I see what you got going on over here.
- All right, chili.

What are you... Are you guys,
like, in a relationship?
249

- Nah, we're just chillin'.
- Are you just chillin'?
250
00:17:52,923 --> 00:17:55,507
Yeah, we're chillin'.

Why haven't I seen you on the field?

Uh.... Just freshmen got to earn
their due, that's all.
254

You take that attitude, you'll spend
the rest of your life on the bench.
255
00:18:09,315 --> 00:18:12,358
It's really not that big of a deal, Mr.
Jacobs. It's just the first season.
256
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,984
No, it is a big deal.
257
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:16,487
You got one of the best
slide-steps I've ever seen.
258

You've got promise.
You've got talent.

You're not pushing yourself
hard enough.

Dad, I think McKay's
gonna be just fine.
261

I'm just trying to help him
keep a girl like her.
262
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:30,084

we're in a relationship.

It's not just football.
It's life.

It's about maintaining your focus.

It's about putting your all
into everything you do.
267

Why do you think I have
the business I have?
268

Why do think I have
the family I have?
269

The success that I have?
270
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:53,107
Why do think this chili

has been voted best chili in the
county five years in a row?
272

'Cause you refuse to lose.
273
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:04,662

Cass, stop.
279

Why would you say that?
280
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,602
That we're just chillin'?
281
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:31,645
It's not that big of a deal,
Cass. It's a figure of speech.
282
00:19:31,647 --> 00:19:33,564
- It is a big deal.
- It's really not.
283
00:19:33,566 --> 00:19:35,566
You literally just told me
that you loved me.
284
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:37,359
What does that have
to do with anything?
285
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:40,404
You just told Nate that we're not
even in a fucking relationship.

What have I done, McKay?
292
00:19:57,757 --> 00:20:00,049
Look, I don't want to talk
about this right now, Cass.
293
00:20:00,051 --> 00:20:01,634
We're in the middle
of a fucking carnival.
294
00:20:01,636 --> 00:20:03,471
I don't know what
you're talking about.
295
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:11,771
It's not like it's that big
of a fucking secret, Cassie.
296
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:18,025
You know what?
It's cool.
297
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:21,614
We should just call it a night.
I gotta get back, anyway.

- So, what you was lookin' for?
- Molly.
299
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:41,300
Oh. She over there workin'
at the pretzel stand.
300
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:43,469
Thank you.
301
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:53,312
Hey.
302
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,188
- Hey.
- You're not having fun?
303
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,234
- No.
- Yeah, me, neither.
304
00:20:59,277 --> 00:21:01,028
You wanna do Molly?
305
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:05,948
Welcome to Pretzelmania.
Can I take your order?
306
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,075
How many pretzels do you want?
307
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:10,869
- We don't eat carbs.
- Two, please.
308
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,748
That'll be forty.
309
00:21:17,628 --> 00:21:19,755
So, you think Nate's
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
cheating on you?
310
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,759
I don't know. He's just been
acting super-weird lately.
311
00:21:28,514 --> 00:21:30,599
Have you gone through his phone?
312
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:34,727
I've never not gone through
someone's phone.
313
00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:36,897
Bitch, you're my soul mate.
314
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,527
Thank you.
315
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:45,654
Yo, what's going
on with you and McKay?
316
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:47,239
I thought you two were in love.
317
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:49,617
Nate asked McKay
if were were in a relationship,
318
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:51,744
and McKay said that
we were just chillin'.
319
00:21:51,746 --> 00:21:53,537
- What?
- Yeah.
320
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:56,665
Honestly, fuck them both.
321
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,334
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
Right?
322
00:21:58,336 --> 00:22:00,461
Okay, so if I
tell you something,
323
00:22:00,463 --> 00:22:02,921
you swear on your fucking life
you won't say a word?
324
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:04,467
Yeah. What?
325
00:22:05,968 --> 00:22:07,762
I went through Nate's phone.
326
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:10,598
And it was weird.
327
00:22:21,859 --> 00:22:23,525
- Oh, my fucking God.
- What?
328
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:25,069
- That's him.
- Who?
329
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,779
The guy.
330
00:22:26,781 --> 00:22:29,823
- What guy?
- The one from the motel.
331
00:22:29,825 --> 00:22:31,408
Okay, what guy are
we looking at, exactly?
332
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,119
Okay, the one in the apron,
serving the chili.
333
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:35,704
- I swear to God.
- No fucking way.
334
00:22:35,706 --> 00:22:37,247
Jules, do you know who that is?
335
00:22:37,249 --> 00:22:39,750
- Yeah, the guy from the motel.
- That's Cal Jacobs.
336
00:22:39,752 --> 00:22:41,752
- Who's that?
- Nate Jacobs's dad.
337
00:22:41,754 --> 00:22:44,755
- That's Nate's dad?
- Yes, that's Nate's dad.
338
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:46,924
- No fucking way!
- Yes, fucking way.
339
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:48,884
- You're full of shit.
- No way.
340
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:50,262
You're full of shit.
341
00:22:51,055 --> 00:22:52,888
Do you... Do you know who he is?
342
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,099
He fucking owns half this town.
He built it.
343
00:22:55,101 --> 00:22:57,059
All the apartment buildings
past Kemper, they're his.
344
00:22:57,061 --> 00:22:58,686
- Rue, I swear to God.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

- There's no way.
345
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,312
- That's the guy I fucked.
- There's no way.
346
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:01,897
Bullshit.
347
00:23:01,899 --> 00:23:04,149
I'm being a hundred percent serious.
348
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:07,361
- You... You don't believe me?
- No, actually.
349
00:23:07,363 --> 00:23:09,657
- I don't.
- Okay. Watch.
350
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:22,420
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hmm?
351
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:27,381
Hi. Can I help you?
352
00:23:27,383 --> 00:23:29,802
Uh, can I please have
a small cup of chili?
353
00:23:31,053 --> 00:23:32,430
Yeah, sure.
354
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,325
Oh.
355
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,575
Shoot.
356
00:23:54,577 --> 00:23:56,203
Sorry.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

357
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:04,043
Uh, it... it's okay.
It was my fault.
358
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,671
I'll get you another cup.
359
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,549
Hi. It's two dollars. All the
proceeds go to the football team.
360
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,010
Uh... cool.
361
00:24:13,012 --> 00:24:14,388
Thank you.
362
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:25,524
Thanks.
363
00:24:29,987 --> 00:24:32,446
Yo, Nate, who was that?
364
00:24:32,448 --> 00:24:35,449
Her name's Jules.
She's new here.
365
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:37,036
She goes to East Highland?
366
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:40,537
Yeah. She's a junior.
367
00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:42,206
Damn. That's jailbait.
368
00:24:42,208 --> 00:24:44,377
That's too bad.
369
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:50,255

- ...nuts!
- Why the fuck did you let me do that?
370
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,216
I didn't let you do that!
You just fucking...
371
00:24:52,218 --> 00:24:55,427
You just did it. You went over
there and you did it.
372
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:57,346
Did you see that
his hands were fucking shaking?
373
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:59,556
- Yes, and then he dropped...
- And then he fucking dropped the chili!
374
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:01,392
- Oh, my God.
- He dropped the fucking chili.
375
00:25:01,394 --> 00:25:03,852
Oh, he dropped the fucking chili.
And then he...
376
00:25:03,854 --> 00:25:05,396
And then you looked at me.
377
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:07,648
Yeah, because
I was screaming inside.
378
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,234
Yeah, well, that made him
fucking look at me.
379
00:25:10,236 --> 00:25:12,069
- He looked at me in the fucking eyes.
- I'm sorry.
380
00:25:12,071 --> 00:25:14,280
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
I feel so bad. That was
literally the meanest thing
381
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:16,198
- I've ever done.
- Oh, shit, hold on. It's my mom.
382
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,868
Hey, Mom.
383
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:21,453
Yeah. Yeah, no.
384
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:24,959
Well, because she's been in the
Gravitron for like 20 straight minutes.
385
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:29,338
Yes, yes. I promise.
We will be home by ten.
386
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,091
Okay, I love you, too.
387
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:35,553
Apparently, Gia's
not answering her phone.
388
00:25:36,762 --> 00:25:38,889
- Uh...
- It's just going straight to voicemail.
389
00:25:45,354 --> 00:25:46,939
It burns.
390
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:52,109
It's so weird
to think that, like,
391
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,528
no matter what happens,
392
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,826
the universe is just out here
giving, like, zero fucks.
393
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:01,579
Wow.
394
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:07,333
- You look super cute.
- Thanks. You, too. I love that shirt.
395
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:10,210
Thank you. Even though I
have the same body as Bruno Mars.
396
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:12,046
- Shut up, you look hot.
- No, I don't.
397
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,631
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't,
398
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,549
'cause
these right here, they're cutlets.
399
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:18,510
No, they're not. Trust me,
these guys are super chill, okay?
400
00:26:18,512 --> 00:26:20,137
Do not worry.
401
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,181
- Your mom's, like, all organic, right?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
402
00:26:22,183 --> 00:26:25,476
- There's your issue.
- What do you mean?
403
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:28,354
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Uh, organic food doesn't
have any good hormones.
404
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:31,357
You gotta get her to buy, like,
the regular stuff, okay?
405
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:33,067
What's the regular stuff?
406
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:35,861
- Trust me. Oh, and milk, and milk.
- No! I hate milk!
407
00:26:35,863 --> 00:26:38,155
At least three glasses a day.
Three glasses.
408
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:40,532
That's how I went
from a small A to a full B.
409
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,076
Mm-hmm.
410
00:26:42,078 --> 00:26:44,078
- Fine, I'll try it.
- I'm telling you.
411
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,413
- You gotta do it.
- How old are the boys again?
412
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:47,792
They're, like, our age.
Yeah.
413
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:50,292
That's a lot.
414
00:26:50,294 --> 00:26:52,294
- I know.
- They are so good.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

415
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,837
- Right?
- I could drink these, like,
416

- every day of my life.
- Yes.
417
00:26:55,466 --> 00:26:58,550
Uh, how 'bout you grab
another slushie,
418
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:02,805
I go get more tickets, and then get
super drunk and ride the Ferris wheel?
419
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,473
Deal.
420
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:06,141
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.
421
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:07,520
All right.
422
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:12,191
- Thank you.
- No problem.
423
00:27:31,794 --> 00:27:33,419
Just tell your sister
I really need her
424
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:35,713
- to cover my shift on Wednesday.
- Okay.
425
00:27:35,715 --> 00:27:38,299
For real. She's not
answering any of my texts.

I promise you I will say something.
427
00:27:40,469 --> 00:27:43,095
I'm supposed to meet my
boyfriend's family for the first time.
428
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:44,680
It's really important.
429
00:27:44,682 --> 00:27:46,432
Yeah, I got you.
430
00:27:46,434 --> 00:27:48,436
Thank you.
You're the best.
431
00:28:00,364 --> 00:28:03,574
- Honestly, fuck that whole family.
- For real.
432
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:06,285
'Cause right now I'm looking at
a thousand versions of myself,
433
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:09,663
and not only do I look good,
I fucking feel good.
434
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,665
- It's a bitch.
- So, if they've got something to say,
435
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,709
they should just say it
to my face, right?
436
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:15,753
Or you could just say it
to their fucking face.
437
00:28:15,755 --> 00:28:18,922
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

- Right?
- That's what I would do.
438
00:28:18,924 --> 00:28:22,593
- I feel like this is a turning point.
- Totally.
439
00:28:22,595 --> 00:28:25,971
We should just pick the hottest,
440
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:30,059
most confident,
bad bitch version of ourselves,
441
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:33,145
and be that for the rest
of the school year.
442
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:35,648
Yo.
443
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,442

Cal Jacobs!

Make it six years and running!
446
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:03,467
Yeah, I'm not supposed
to be here right now,
447
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:05,135
because I'm dressed like a hooker,
448

00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:32,204
You wanna ride the carousel?
456
00:29:32,206 --> 00:29:34,123
Cool.
457
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:37,001
Shit.
She's not answering.
458
00:29:37,003 --> 00:29:40,129
- It's just going straight to voicemail.
- I mean, she can't be too far.
459
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:42,506
Well, I have to get her home
in like, 30 minutes.
460
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:45,301
- Gia!
- Gia!
461

Excuse me. Sorry.
462
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:49,807
Gia!
463
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,312
- Gia!
- Gia!
464
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,149
Fuck. Okay. Uh...
465
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:01,900
It'd be faster if we split up.
466
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:04,488
- Yeah. Okay. Text me. Thank you.
- Okay.
467
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,698
I'm not
gonna let you fucking embarrass me
468
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,660
like that again,
I swear to fucking God.
469
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:12,870
Shut the fuck up!
I'm fucking done with you!
470
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:14,496
- I'm so fucking done with you.
- So what else is new?
471
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:16,081
- I'm not fucking joking.
- Yeah, fucking right.
472
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,334
Calling my mom a cunt.
What the fuck is actually wrong
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
473
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:20,379
- with your fucking brain?
- I think you're overreacting.
474
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:26,675
You're fucking dead to me.
475
00:30:26,677 --> 00:30:28,137
Fuck you.
476
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:32,975
- I do have one question, though.
- Yo, what?
477
00:30:36,854 --> 00:30:40,856
Man, I'm telling you, that
girl has some real, fucking issues.
478
00:30:40,858 --> 00:30:42,902
I have to use the bathroom.
479
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:46,072
Gia!
480
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:49,909
Gia!
481
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,787
Gia!
482
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:28,698
Got an extra cigarette?
483
00:32:01,272 --> 00:32:03,399
Damn, you're so fucking hot.
484
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,070
I could ride the carousel for hours!
485
00:32:11,574 --> 00:32:13,991
- Emma. Yo.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

- Yo, Rue. What up?
486
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:17,536
- Have you seen Gia?
- Yeah, like, over there.
487
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:20,623
- Over where? Where is she?
- You know. Like, the Gravitron.
488
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,542
- Is she in the Gravitron?
- No, she's like, by it.
489
00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:25,880
I... I really have to pee.
490
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:37,058
Gia!
491
00:32:46,567 --> 00:32:48,108
Gia!
492
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,652
Gia!
493
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:52,154
Aren't you Luke Kasten?
494
00:32:52,156 --> 00:32:53,697
Yeah.
495
00:32:53,699 --> 00:32:55,991
You used to go
to East Highland, right?
496
00:32:55,993 --> 00:32:58,829
Yeah, like, fuckin' forever ago.
497
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:03,624
I used to hear stories about you,
like, all the time in middle school.

498
00:33:03,626 --> 00:33:05,628
Oh, yeah?
What kind of stories?
499
00:33:08,506 --> 00:33:10,255
That you had a...
500
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,927
have a really big dick and
fucked every girl in your grade.
501
00:33:15,346 --> 00:33:17,056
Basically.
502
00:33:17,848 --> 00:33:19,558
That's cool.
503
00:33:21,894 --> 00:33:23,688
How old are you?
504
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,359
Sixteen.
505
00:33:59,056 --> 00:34:02,057
I'm just saying, as your girlfriend,
those pictures are a little suspicious.
506
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:03,601
It's not what it looks like.
507
00:34:03,603 --> 00:34:05,311
Yeah? Well, then, explain
to me why you have
508
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:07,896
someone else's dick in your phone.
509
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:09,857
It's really fucking complicated.
510
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:34:09,859 --> 00:34:12,484
How many reasons could there be?
511
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:14,528
I can't explain it to you right now.
512
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,655
Yeah, what does that mean?
513
00:34:16,657 --> 00:34:19,535
Look, I'm going through
a lot of shit right now.
514
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,954
I need... I just...
I need you to promise me
515
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:25,664
that you're not gonna tell a soul.
516
00:34:25,666 --> 00:34:27,666
I am not gonna
tell anyone, I promise.
517
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,336
- Like, on your life.
- Yeah, on my life.
518
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:33,382
I'm sorry I got so angry
at you before.
519
00:34:34,884 --> 00:34:36,594
I am sorry.
520
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,642
I'm sorry.
521
00:34:46,771 --> 00:34:48,356
I love you.

Maddy, I love you.
523
00:34:53,486 --> 00:34:55,235
I got a lot of sh...
524
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:57,823
a lot of shit going on right
now and I'm really confused.
525
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:00,451
I don't know what to do.
526
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:24,869
Ho, ho, ho. Nasty!
527
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:53,856
Gia!
528
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,567
What the hell?
I've been calling you.
529
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:00,196
Rue.
530
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:05,534
- Are you stoned right now?
- Nah. Um-mm.
531
00:37:08,996 --> 00:37:10,996
- We're just chillin'.
- Yeah, that's my sister.
532
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,581
- Yo, Roy.
- What's up?
533
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,416
This is Rue's little sis.
534
00:37:14,418 --> 00:37:17,920
Oh, yeah. I knew that by the

way she was hittin' the weed.
535
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:19,546
That's me.
536
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:21,298
All right, Gia, get up.
Let's go.
537
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,969
What do you mean, let's go?
You see we're having a funky good time.
538
00:37:24,971 --> 00:37:27,554
- That's great.
- I'm having the best time.
539
00:37:27,556 --> 00:37:30,015
- We need to go, now.
- We having the best time.
540
00:37:30,017 --> 00:37:31,684
Gia, get the fuck up and let's go.
541
00:37:31,686 --> 00:37:33,227
- I'm not playing with you.
- Wow.
542
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:35,437
What'd you do?
Decide to just clean up,
543
00:37:35,439 --> 00:37:37,731
- and, like, oh, I wanna become a mom?
- Right?
544
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:41,568
- Gia, get the fuck up. Let's go. Now.
- Mom. What's your problem, Mom?
545
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,907
Hey, if she's a mom,
you know she a MILF.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Get up.
547
00:37:48,494 --> 00:37:50,997
Yo, for real. When'd you
become such a bitch?
548
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:57,126
Excuse me?
549
00:37:57,128 --> 00:37:59,463
Was it after you fuckin' OD'd?
550
00:38:01,966 --> 00:38:05,592
Yeah. It's good.
I know it's only weed,
551
00:38:05,594 --> 00:38:07,763
but you might get addicted.
552
00:38:10,016 --> 00:38:11,557
Get up.
553
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,145
Just hope you don't
get addicted again.
554
00:38:15,896 --> 00:38:17,813
All I'm saying is, if I were you,
555
00:38:17,815 --> 00:38:20,151
I wouldn't be taking
advice from her.
556
00:38:21,819 --> 00:38:24,155
Yo. Text me.
557
00:38:25,197 --> 00:38:27,489

Hey.

Look, I know you have the power
to ruin my life right now.
561

I'm begging you,
562

pleading with you,
563
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:57,063
please don't.
564
00:38:58,773 --> 00:39:01,607
I know you already told your friend.
I saw her look at me.
565
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:04,193
She won't tell anyone.
566
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:07,029
- I promise.
- 'Cause if this ever came out,
567
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,992
I'd lose everything.
I'd lose everything.
568
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:14,997
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
569
00:39:20,336 --> 00:39:25,216
I have no intention of, like,
hurting you or anything.

I'm sorry about earlier.
571
00:39:31,931 --> 00:39:33,766
That was kind of dumb.
572
00:39:36,352 --> 00:39:37,812
That's okay.
573
00:39:39,981 --> 00:39:41,399
I just wanted to...
574
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:43,901
It won't be a thing.
575
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,405
- Don't worry.
- Thank you.
576
00:39:49,115 --> 00:39:50,700
Thank you so much.
577
00:40:26,235 --> 00:40:28,235
Where were you?
578
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:30,988
- What's wrong?
- I just think the Molly's, like,
579
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,743
way too strong or something.
580
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:46,045
So... did you come?
581
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:47,465
No.
582
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,267
Uh, do you think Mom's gonna be
583
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:02,436
sitting in the living room
when we get there?
584
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:04,607
- No, she won't.
- Okay.
585
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:08,110
Because, if, um...
586
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:11,946
If I walked in there,
I wouldn't know what to say.
587
00:41:11,948 --> 00:41:15,407
- I wouldn't say hi.
- No, she's... She's gonna be in her bed.
588
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:18,202
Trust me. Look, I need you,
when we get home,
589
00:41:18,204 --> 00:41:20,913
to just go straight to your room
and hide under the covers. Okay?
590
00:41:20,915 --> 00:41:23,165
Just let me deal with her.
591
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:25,834
Wh-what are you gonna tell her?
592
00:41:25,836 --> 00:41:28,005
I don't know yet.
593
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,635
What are you laughing at?
594
00:41:34,261 --> 00:41:35,846
You good?

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

Come here.
596
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:50,818
She's still a little sick from
riding the Gravitron so many times.
597
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,864
- Should I check on her?
- Oh, no. It's good. I got it.
598
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,536
Thank you for looking out
for her tonight.
599
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:02,204
- Of course.
- Love you.
600

- Love you, too. Good night, Mom.
- Good night.
601
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:23,955
Hey. Shut the door.
602
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:06,098
Hey.
603
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:09,560
Tyler?
604
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,370
No. No!
605
00:45:29,372 --> 00:45:31,497
No, I'm not trying
to hurt you. I'm not.

8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:36,460
I know that you have
these ideas about me,
608
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:38,673
based on the first time that
we met, and I understand that.
609
00:45:40,091 --> 00:45:42,176
But I'm not the person
that you met that night.
610
00:45:43,135 --> 00:45:44,512
Can you let go of me?
611
00:46:02,113 --> 00:46:04,282
You know, over the past few weeks...
612
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:07,660
I've spent...
613
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:11,747
every moment of every day
getting to know you.
614
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:15,876
At night...
615
00:46:16,669 --> 00:46:18,296
I fall asleep to you.
616
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,882
And in the morning...
617
00:46:22,717 --> 00:46:24,093
I wake up to you.
618
00:46:27,054 --> 00:46:31,475
I kind of feel closer to you than I
do to anyone in the whole world.

I don't trust you, either.

Wider.
623
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:23,319
Nate. Nate, stop.
624
00:47:25,613 --> 00:47:28,115
God, are you broken inside.
625
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:31,994
And that's precisely why
I don't trust you.
626
00:47:35,957 --> 00:47:39,126
Because you're so broken
you don't even trust yourself.
627
00:47:41,337 --> 00:47:43,381
And that's scary.
628
00:47:44,465 --> 00:47:48,175
Not just for you, but for me.
629
00:47:48,177 --> 00:47:50,596
And for my entire family.
630
00:47:53,307 --> 00:47:56,517
I wouldn't answer that.
You're gonna wanna hear this.
631
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:59,895
Over the last three weeks,
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
632
00:47:59,897 --> 00:48:04,149
you have knowingly produced and
distributed child pornography.
633
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:07,569
Including obscene images that
were taken on school property.
634
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:10,489
I've compiled all these photos,
635
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:14,662
along with an IP address, and an
account that's linked to your name.
636
00:48:16,914 --> 00:48:20,459
I don't know if you're familiar with
child pornography laws in this state.
637
00:48:22,169 --> 00:48:25,589
But they apply to minors
just as they apply to adults.
638
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:29,008
I sent them to you.
639
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:31,302
No. You sent them
640
00:48:31,304 --> 00:48:34,223
to an account of a person
that doesn't fucking exist.
641
00:48:35,391 --> 00:48:39,228
And I mean, anyone can anonymously
report child pornography, right?
642
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:44,523
- Then I'd tell them everything.
- Okay.
643
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:47,901
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

You could do that, but, um...
644
00:48:47,903 --> 00:48:50,406
here's what would definitely happen.
645
00:48:52,658 --> 00:48:55,161
You'd end up on
a sex offenders list.
646
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:58,873
It means no more college.
647
00:49:00,207 --> 00:49:03,628
It's gonna be very fucking
difficult to find a job.
648
00:49:06,922 --> 00:49:09,131
And everywhere you go,
649
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:11,800
for the rest of your life,
650
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:14,303
you'll be harassed, and spat at,
651
00:49:14,305 --> 00:49:16,265
and treated like a fucking animal.
652
00:49:17,975 --> 00:49:21,812
You deserve better than that.
'Cause I know you.
653
00:49:23,856 --> 00:49:26,233
You're kind.
654
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:30,110
You're smart.
You're generous.
655
00:49:30,112 --> 00:49:32,237
You got a big heart.
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE

656
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,577
You deserve whatever the fuck it
is in this world that you want.
657
00:49:38,663 --> 00:49:40,412
So keep your head down.
658
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,375
Keep your mouth shut.
659
00:49:44,335 --> 00:49:47,169
Don't try to ruin my life,
660
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:49,590
and I won't have to ruin yours.
661
00:49:52,718 --> 00:49:54,845
You know what I think?
662
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:00,101
I think you're a fucking faggot,
just like your daddy.
663
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,282
You have a nice night.
664
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,080
- Hey.
- Hey.
665
00:51:05,082 --> 00:51:07,710
Do you think
I could, uh, sleep over?
666
00:51:08,586 --> 00:51:10,963
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Come on.
667
00:51:49,627 --> 00:51:51,253
Is everything okay?
668
8FLiX.com TRANSCRIPTS DATABASE
FOR EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY
00:51:58,386 --> 00:52:00,260
Um...
669
00:52:00,262 --> 00:52:02,014
Here.
670
00:52:04,058 --> 00:52:06,850
So how'd the date go with Tyler?
671
00:52:06,852 --> 00:52:08,562
Um...
672
00:52:18,114 --> 00:52:20,658
He didn't look like his picture.
673
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:40,928
Come here.
674
00:53:03,284 --> 00:53:05,202
Are you sure you're okay?
675
00:54:11,102 --> 00:54:12,520
What?
