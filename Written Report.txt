Team Project Update #2 

Introduction:
	In this paper, we will look into the frequency of disfluencies in scripted spontaneous speech versus actual spontaneous speech throughout films. 
  More specifically, we would like to look at how they compare and if disfluencies in scripted speech occur as often as they do in actual spontaneous speech. 
  Our hypothesis is that they will not occur as often in scripted spontaneous speech as they do in actual spontaneous speech because scripted spontaneous speech 
  can only mimic actual speech to an extent. We will take a look at spontaneous speech just for English in our data sets. In terms of the disfluencies we will 
  examine, we have decided to narrow it down to the use of “um” and “uh.” This will allow us to look at the more common disfluencies across the English language 
  and have clearer counts for the disfluencies that occur in both settings. We think this topic is particularly of interest because of the way scripted speech 
  looks at language patterns in order to mimic real life situations. It’s interesting to see when disfluencies are used and why they may be used across speech. 
  One of the articles mentions using one disfluency over the other to indicate a form of politeness in natural spontaneous speech. Looking at these types of 
  patterns may help film writers understand when it is appropriate to use certain disfluencies and insert it correspondingly in scripted speech. This can 
  definitely be very informative when it comes to speech studies and attempting to imitate speech as naturally as possible for not only film writers, but even 
  machine language generators. 

Background:
	In his article, Ralph L. Rose actually spoke on the frequency of various disfluencies in natural and scripted spontaneous speech. Similarly, this researcher 
  was interested in the natural occurrence of these disfluencies in everyday speech and how well films and movies were able to replicate the use of them. With 
  the data he gathered, he was able to find that the occurrences for them were actually quite similar across natural spontaneous speech and scripted spontaneous 
  speech. When it came to differences however, most of them came from the level of structural distribution. This was a reference to the use of disfluencies across 
  boundary and non-boundary positions. Sentence boundaries refer to the capitalization of “Um” and “Uh,” meanwhile, sentence non-boundary refers to disfluencies 
  that are not capitalized. 


Methods:
	We will collect our data by looking at transcripts of natural speech through the corpus provided by UC Santa Barbara. Their linguistics department website is 
  able to provide transcriptions of different conversations which we will use for the data on actual spontaneous speech to look out for the disfluencies “um” and 
  “uh.” In order to capture data for scripted spontaneous speech, we used a corpus that contained subtitles for different movies. This data is provided by an 
  OpenSubtitles corpus. We will use the data from the subtitles in order to locate disfluencies across their script, and specifically, we will look for the 
  disfluencies “um” and “uh” as well.
